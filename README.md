# Algorithm Visualiser

## Introduction
The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to help users understand the working of various sorting algorithms through dynamic visualizations. The application represents data as bars of different heights, which are manipulated and animated to simulate the sorting process in real-time. By offering a hands-on approach to learning algorithms, this project serves as an educational tool for students, developers, and anyone interested in computer science fundamentals.

## Features
Key features of your application.

1. Algorithm Visualizer
2. AI Code Editor


## Design Pattern
We are following Dark Moder with light mode on algorithm page.

## Installation & Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yesutkarsh/B41_WEB_005_Responsive-Rebels.git
```

```bash
npm i
```
Open with live server or open index file in root directory/frontend directory.



## Usage
After Cloning Repo
1. npm init
2. Open With Live Server or open index.html file form root
3. Inside Frontend Folder we have algorithm folder which contains all the algorithm we have implemented so far.




## APIs Used
For test purpose only I have provide my own api key but you must proceed with your own api key in .env file




## Technology Stack
- Html
- Css
- Javascript
- Reminxicon as library for icon
- gemini sdk and api
